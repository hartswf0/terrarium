/**
 * THE PALETTES.
 *
 * A palette is not decoration; it is an argument about what should be legible.
 * Each of these is built around a claim:
 *
 *   Night      the room is dark and the land should glow faintly
 *   Black      true black, for a phone outdoors at night and for saving power
 *   Daylight   the room is bright and the land is a lit model
 *   Parchment  warm ground, brown ink — the surveyed drawing, not the photograph
 *   Ink        the land nearly recedes so the LINES carry everything
 *
 * The mistake in the first attempt at Paper was tonal range: ground 0.955 and
 * groundHigh 0.985 is a three-percent spread, so a hillside had nowhere to go
 * and the whole place blew out to white. Every palette below keeps at least a
 * fifth of the scale between low ground and high, whatever its key.
