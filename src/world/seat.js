// SEATING — what it costs the ground to accept a building.
//
// A building put on a hillside does not hover and it does not sink. The ground
// is cut away above it and built up below it until there is something level to
// stand on, and the disturbed earth is battered back to the natural slope
// around the edges. That earthwork is the real content of "placing a building
// on terrain": it has a volume, a price, a visible extent, and consequences for
// where the water goes.
//
// So this does not move a model until it is level. It changes the GROUND, and
// then everything already reading the ground — the contours, the roads and
// surfaces draped on it, the water model, the routes people walk — answers to
// the new shape without being told. That is why the drape had to be exact
// before this could exist.
