// operative/radiography.js — light the inside and see where it gets out.
//
// Every check in this project so far has had to know what it was looking for.
// UNJOINED knows about fasteners. PONDING knows about slope. ACCESS_BLOCKED knows
// about NEC 110.26. Each one answers a question somebody thought to ask, and the
// things that hurt are the ones nobody thought to ask about — the wall skin that
// stopped at the top plate and left a band of open air right round the building,
// found by accident, in a photograph.
//
// This asks nothing. It fills the inside with light and records where the light
// gets out. A ray does not need to know what a wall is; it only needs to not hit
// one. Anywhere a ray escapes that is not a window is a hole, and the map of
// escapes is a map of the holes, whether or not anyone has a rule for them.
//
// The dome is the film. Sit a sphere outside the building, fire rays from inside,
// and every ray that reaches the sphere exposes a point on it. A sealed building
// exposes nothing. A building with a seam exposes a line.
//
// AND — the reason this matters more than another check:
//
//   Fire the same rays at a box you *know* is sealed. If they get out, the
//   instrument is broken, not the building.
//
// That is `calibrate()`, and it is the difference between "the building is
// fucked" and "our eyes are fucked". No other check in here can tell those apart.
