// operative/comfort.js — fitting is not the same as being able to bear it.
//
// inhabit.js answers whether a body fits and can get there. That is the floor,
// not the ceiling. A seat you fit on can still be one you cannot sit at for
// twenty minutes; a sink you can reach can still be one you have to lean over
// because there is nowhere to put your toes.
//
// Every criterion here is a published minimum or a dimension off the body, and
// every one names which. Where a thing fails, it fails by a number.
//
// Two rules from the brief, and both change the answers:
//
//   NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO CROUCH. A fridge you kneel for is a design fault, not
//   a posture. Storage below knee height is counted against the design.
//
//   THE SERVICES ARE IN THE ROOM. `world.solids()` drops runs, and runs are the
//   hundred and thirteen wires and pipes in this trailer. Every clearance in this
//   file is measured against the building with its plumbing in it.
