// operative/where.js — where is it fucked, and what kind of fucked is it.
//
// The loop has one question — what sucks — and it asks it of the whole trailer at
// once. That was fine when the answer was "the electrical is floating"; it is
// useless now that the answer is a list of 17 gable pairs, 88 escaping rays, an
// unreachable bed and 429 contacts nothing has a rule for. A criticism that
// applies to the whole building tells the builder nothing about where to stand.
//
// So every finding gets three coordinates, and the loop can be pointed:
//
//   ZONE       where on the trailer — fore of the axles, over them, aft; and
//              which surface: floor, wall, roof. The axle zone matters because
//              that is where the trailer is 77 in wide instead of 94 and where
//              every plan problem in this build turned out to live.
//   SYSTEM     what trade owns it — frame, envelope, services, fit-out, the road.
//   PATHOLOGY  what kind of wrong it is, independent of where. Unfastened is the
//              same disease in a rafter and in a hitch coupler, and grouping by
//              it is how you notice you have the disease rather than the symptom.
